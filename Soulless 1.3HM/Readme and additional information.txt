Soulless Hard Mode 

Creators: Algeran, Arche, Razzor

Original Soulless Creators: Algeran, Redire, Arche

Special Thanks: Algeran, Redire

This is a mod of Soulless which makes it harder. 
You can track your best hitcount and your nohit time PB.
You have everything unlocked from the start (Infinite Practice and Items)
Every trinket was changed to Absolute Bow, with the exception of the last one, which was changed to nothing.

When the creators released the source code for this game, there was already
a hardmode built in, with around 25% of the attacks being buffed, and they were
buffed by Algeran and Arche, which is why I put them as creators of the hardmode.

You should play the original Soulless if you haven't.
